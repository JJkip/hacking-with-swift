//MORE CLOSURE EXAMPLES
/*A closure that takes two integers and returns their sum:*/
let sum = { (a: Int, b: Int) -> Int in

let result4 = sum(4,8)

let evenNumbers = numbers.filter { $0 % 2 == 0 }

//Reducing an array to a single value
let sumNumbers = numbers.reduce(0) { $0 + $1}

/*In the above example, the reduce method on the numbers array takes an initial value and a closure as arguments. The closure combines each element of the array with the accumulated value to produce a new value. The $0 and $1 shorthand syntax represent the accumulated value and the current element being reduced, respectively. The final result is the sum of all the elements in the array.*/
//Filtering an array of dictionaries:
let people = [
    ["name":"Alice", "age": 31],
    ["name":"Bob", "age": 15],
    ["name":"Charlie", "age": 36]

let adults = people.filter { $0["age"] as? Int ?? 0 >= 30 }

/*In the above example, the filter method on the people array of dictionaries takes a closure as an argument that returns a Boolean value indicating whether a dictionary should be included in the filtered array. The $0 shorthand syntax represents each dictionary being filtered, and the closure checks if the "age" key is an Int greater than or equal to 30.*/


/*Closures and how they can be used to create closures with captured values from its surrounding context. This means that it can access variables and constants from the scope in which it is defined. For example:*/
func makeAdder(forIncreament amount: Int) -> (() -> Int) {

        runningTotal += amount
        return runningTotal
    }

let add5 = makeAdder(forIncreament: 5)
let add10 = makeAdder(forIncreament: 10)
print(add5())
print(add5())
print(add10())
print(add10())
print(add5())
/*In the above example, makeAdder(forIncrement:) is a function that returns a closure. The closure captures the runningTotal variable from the function's scope and increments it by the specified amount. The makeAdder(forIncrement:) function is called twice to create two separate closures: add5 and add10. Each closure has its own runningTotal variable that is separate from the other closure's variable.*/

/*Delaying execution of a piece of code:*/
func delay(_ seconds: Double, closure: @escaping () -> Void){
    DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + seconds, execute: closure)
}
print("Start")
delay(1) {
    print("Delayed execution")
}
print("End")
/*In the above example, the delay function takes a number of seconds and a closure as arguments. The closure is executed after the specified number of seconds have passed, using the asyncAfter method on a dispatch queue. The @escaping keyword indicates that the closure can escape the function's scope and be executed later.*/

/*Using a closure to perform a task on a background thread*/
func performTaskInBackground(_ task: @escaping () -> Void) {
    DispatchQueue.global(qos: .background).async {
        task()
    }
}

performTaskInBackground {
    print("This task is running on a background thread")
}
/*In above example, the performTaskInBackground function takes a closure as an argument that represents a task to be performed on a background thread. The closure is executed asynchronously on a background thread using the global(qos:) method on a dispatch queue.*/

//Capturing values from the enclosing scope
func makeCounter() -> () -> Int{
    var count = 0
    return {
        count += 1
        return count
    }
}
let counter = makeCounter()
print(counter())
print(counter())
print(counter())
print(counter())
/*In this example, the makeCounter function returns a closure that captures a local variable count from the enclosing scope. Each time the closure is called, the count variable is incremented and its new value is returned. The counter variable is assigned the returned closure and can be called multiple times to generate a sequence of incremented values.*/
